## [GameCollector unreleased]

## [3.0.0]

First GameCollector release, expanding scope of upstream GameFinder.  Note the API has changed quite a bit.

in progress:
- Now using a generic Game record rather than a different type for each StoreHandler, with additional fields (handler support varies):
  - Launch, Icon, Uninstall, LastRunDate, IsInstalled, and miscellaneous Metadata
- `FindAllGames` optionally returns owned but not-installed games (handler support varies)
- Added support for additional StoreHandlers:
  - Amazon Games
  - Arc
  - Blizzard Battle.net
  - Humble App
  - Indiegala IGClient
  - itch
  - Riot Client
  - Ubisoft Connect
- Re-added deprecated Bethesda.net and Xbox packages for posterity
- several upgraded NuGet packages

planned:
- Adding support for Big Fish, Game Jolt, Legacy Games, Oculus, Paradox, Plarium, Rockstar, and Wargaming.net
- Changing GOG implementation to database method (more robust, may survive a Windows reinstall)

## [GameCollector releases]

None

## [GameFinder unreleased]

None

## [GameFinder releases]

## [2.6.0] - 2023-03-07

- removed support for `net6.0`
- add support for finding Wine prefixes (check the [README](./README.md#linux-tools))
- Steam: added new default installation directories:
    - `~/.steam/debian-installation` (apparently used on Debian/Ubuntu systems)
    - `~/.var/app/com.valvesoftware.Steam/data/Steam` (used by the flatpak installation)
    - `~/.steam/steam` (legacy installation, links to another installation)

## [2.5.0] - 2023-01-17

Added support for EA Desktop. Read the [wiki entry](https://github.com/erri120/GameFinder/wiki/EA-Desktop) before using.

## [2.4.0] - 2023-01-13

Although this release contains some API changes and a lot of internal changes, consumers will likely not be affected.

- Core: `AHandler.FindAllGamesById` now returns `IDictionary<>` instead of `Dictionary<>`
- Core: changed `Result<TGame>` from a record struct to a custom readonly struct
- Steam: added `SteamGame.GetManifestPath` that returns the absolute path to the parsed manifest. This is useful if you need to extract more information from the manifest, after the game has been found.
- Internal: restructured the project and reworked all tests

## [2.3.0] - 2022-12-16

- Steam: added `~/.steam` and `~/.local/.steam` as possible default Steam directories on Linux
- Steam: added constructor that accepts a custom Steam path in case the library can't find it
- upgrade to C# 11
- upgrade `System.IO.Abstractions` to v19.1.1

## [2.2.2] - 2022-11-11

- `FindAllGamesById` will no longer throw an exception for duplicate IDs

## [2.2.1] - 2022-10-21

Small update that changes the equality comparer of the dictionary returned by `EGSHandler.FindAllGamesById` and `OriginHandler.FindAllGamesById` to `StringComparer.OrdinalIgnoreCase`.

## [2.2.0] - 2022-10-21

This update adds some utility functions you can use. I've also created a new package `GameFinder.Common` where all those new utility functions live:

- added `AHandler` an abstract class that all store handlers inherit:
  - `AHandler.FindAllGames`: same function as before
  - `AHandler.FindAllGamesById`: wraps `FindAllGames` and returns a `Dictionary<TId, TGame>`
  - `AHandler.FindOneGameById`: if you just need to find 1 game
- added some extension methods that work with `IEnumerable<Result<TGame>> results`:
  - `IEnumerable<TGame> OnlyGames`: returns only non-null games and discards the rest
  - `IEnumerable<string> OnlyErrors`: returns only non-null errors and discards the rest
  - `(TGame[] games, string[] errors) SplitResults`: splits the results into two arrays

## [2.1.0] - 2022-10-21

Minor update after the major rework:

- everything was made safer and less functions will throw (you should still wrap the `FindAllGames` function call)
- API changed a bit: `FindAllGames` will now return a readonly record struct instead of a named tuple
- lots of internal changes and more tests

## [2.0.1] - 2022-10-19

- Origin: fix parsing manifests with duplicate key-value entries

## [2.0.0] - 2022-10-15

Major rework of all packages:

- removed `netstandard2.1` target
- added `net7.0` target
- added `IRegistry` interface with `WindowsRegistry` and `InMemoryRegistry` implementations
- added runtime platform check in all packages
- deprecated the Bethesda.net and Xbox packages (see [README](./README.md) for more information)
- removed logging from all packages
- removed the `GameFinder` package (it's not needed anymore)
- simplified the public APIs

## [1.8.0] - 2022-06-27

- Fix SteamHandler not finding any Libraries when there are no external libs
- Remove .NET 5 target
- Upgrade dependencies

## [1.7.3] - 2022-05-14

### Changes

## [1.7.2] - 2021-11-10

### Changes

- GOG: most stuff is no longer required from the registry, the only values that actually matter are `gameID`, `gameName`, `path`
- Xbox: updated Windows SDK to 10.0.20348.0

## [1.7.1] - 2021-08-19

### Fixed

- Steam: Fixed Regex for parsing old `libraryfolders.vdf` files
- Origin: Fixed returning invalid Paths

## [1.6.1] - 2021-07-10

### Added

## [1.6.0] - 2021-07-10

This update reverted the change from [v1.5.0](#150---2021-05-29) because it did not perform very well, made the code worse and harder to read and felt like a quick and dirty fix. The reason why I even added `Result<T>` was to let the consumer of this library, which should be an application, know what went wrong by returning something akin to Rust's error propagation. Instead of having an exception whenever something went wrong, it would just add another error as a `string` to a `List<string>` inside the `Result<T>` which the consumer can access and print out. I have removed all of this code and replaced it with simple logging using `ILogger` from `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging`. This way you can simply pass a `ILogger` to the constructor of a Store Handler and it will log to it. Since the consumer of this library is an application which likely has some form of logging going on, this should be very easy to implement.

Additionally I finally went ahead and added Origin Support, see the [README](README.md) for more information.

### Changed

- Using `ILogger` from `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging` instead of custom `Result<T>` to let the user know what went wrong

### Added

- Added Origin Support, see [README](README.md) for more information

## [1.5.3] - 2021-06-13

### Changed

- Steam: Fixed double slashes in Paths ([#8](https://github.com/erri120/GameFinder/issues/8))
- Steam: Improved parsing of `config.vdf`, `libraryfolders.vdf` and `*.acf` files

## [1.5.2] - 2021-06-09

### Changed

- Steam, GOG and EGS Handlers will not also include init errors in the final result
- Steam: Added support for new `libraryfolders.vdf` format introduced in update 1623193086 (2021-06-08). See README for more information.

## [1.5.1] - 2021-06-06

### Changed

- Steam: `libraryfolders.vdf` will now also get parsed ([#7](https://github.com/erri120/GameFinder/pull/7))

## [1.5.0] - 2021-05-29

### Changed

All functions are now no-throw and return `Return<T>` for better error handling and error aggregation. Checkout the example on how to use this: [Link](https://github.com/erri120/GameFinder/blob/20f1cefda485cb7e22fa158cc29ff06fe2b96e21/GameFinder.Example/Program.cs#L43-L57).
