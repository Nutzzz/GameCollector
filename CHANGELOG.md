# Changelog

## Unreleased

**TODO**:

- Add unit tests
- Update documentation

**Changes**:

- Added a generic `record GameData` to collect data for all handlers:
  - `string GameId`
  - `string Name`
  - `AbsolutePath Path`
  - `AbsolutePath? SavePath`
  - `AbsolutePath Launch`
  - `string LaunchArgs`
  - `string LaunchUrl`
  - `AbsolutePath Icon`
  - `AbsolutePath Uninstall`
  - `string UninstallArgs`
  - `string UninstallUrl`
  - `DateTime? InstallDate`
  - `DateTime? LastRunDate`
  - `uint NumRuns`
  - `TimeSpan? RunTime`
  - `bool IsInstalled`
  - `bool IsHidden`
  - `bool HasProblem`
  - `List<string>? Tags`
  - `ushort? MyRating`
  - `string? BaseGame`
  - `Dictionary<string, List<string>>? Metadata`
- Metadata may include (depending on available information) "ReleaseDate", "Description", "Developers", "Publishers", "Genres", "ImageUrl", etc.
- The `IGame` implementations from GameFinder are now subclasses of `GameData`. This should hopefully make merging with upstream easier.
- Added emulators:
  - Dolphin, MAME
- Added additional store launchers:
  - Amazon, Arc, Battle.net, Big Fish, Game Jolt, Humble, IGClient, itch, Legacy, Oculus, Paradox, Plarium, Riot, Rockstar, Ubisoft, Wargaming.net
- Add `FindClient` to get path to store client executable.
- EADesktop handler now attempts to get a proper game title from the Registry.
- EGS and GOG handlers now use the client databases to find owned not-installed games and acquire additional information about all games. The GOG handler will be able to find installed games after a Windows system reset or reinstall.
- Steam handler can now use [SteamWebAPI2](https://github.com/babelshift/SteamWebAPI2) library to collect information about owned, not-installed games. This feature requires an API key to be specified and the user profile set to public.

# Upstream Changelog

## [Unreleased](https://github.com/erri120/GameFinder/compare/v3.1.0...HEAD)

## [Released](https://github.com/erri120/GameFinder/releases)

## [3.1.0](https://github.com/erri120/GameFinder/compare/v3.0.2...v3.1.0) - TBD

**Changes**:

- Steam: added `CloudSavesDirectory` to `SteamGame`.
- Fixed `AWinePrefix.CreateRegistry` throwing an exception when the file doesn't exist. It will now do a check and early exist with an empty registry, if the registry file doesn't exist.
- Fixed `WMIHelper` throwing an exception when WMI returns more than one element.
- Marked `GameFinder.StoreHandlers.EADesktop` as non-trimmable. It uses the WMI, which itself requires COM, which is disabled when trimming is enabled.

## [3.0.2](https://github.com/erri120/GameFinder/compare/v3.0.1...v3.0.2) - 2023-05-10

**Changes**:

- Converted `AWinePrefix` and all inheritors into record types.
- Added `DebuggerDisplay` to `ErrorMessage`.

## [3.0.1](https://github.com/erri120/GameFinder/compare/v3.0.0...v3.0.1) - 2023-05-10

First small release after the major [3.0.0](#300---2023-05-09) release.

**Changes**:

- Added `AHandler`. This is a non-generic abstract base class, inherited by `AHandler<TGame, TId>` and should alleviate some of the issues with generics hell. This class only has one method `IEnumerable<OneOf<IGame, ErrorMessage>> FindAllInterfaceGames()` which makes use of the new `IGame` interface added in [3.0.0](#300---2023-05-09).

## [3.0.0](https://github.com/erri120/GameFinder/compare/v2.6.0...v3.0.0) - 2023-05-09

This is a major release with big changes featuring Wine, Bottles and Proton support for GOG, EGS and Origin. This release also replaces [`System.IO.Abstraction`](https://github.com/TestableIO/System.IO.Abstractions) with `NexusMods.Paths` from the new [Nexus Mods App](https://github.com/Nexus-Mods/NexusMods.App), changes how results are handled and re-adds [Xbox Game Pass](./README.md#xbox-game-pass) support.

**Breaking Changes**:

- Reworked the constructors of all handlers and removed most overloads. All handlers now have a single constructor with no default values.
- Updated `FindAllGames` to return `OneOf<TGame, ErrorMessage>` instead of `Result<TGame>` (using the [OneOf](https://github.com/mcintyre321/OneOf) library).
- Replaced `System.IO.Abstraction` with `NexusMods.Path.IFileSystem`.
  - Paths are now of type `AbsolutePath` instead of `string`.
- Changed `AHandler<TGame, TId>` to require `TId : notnull`.
- Added `IGame` interface and changed `AHandler<TGame, TId>` to require `TGame : IGame`.
- Removed the extension functions `OnlyGame` and `OnlyError`.
- Changed all game Ids to be value objects using [Vogen](https://github.com/SteveDunn/Vogen).
- Changed `FindAllGamesById` to return `IReadOnlyDictionary<TGame, TId>` instead of `IDictionary<TGame, TId>`.

**(Hopefully) non-breaking changes**:

- Re-added Xbox Game Pass.
- Added `Func<TGame, TId> IdSelector` and `IEqualityComparer<TId>? IdEqualityComparer` to `AHandler<TGame, TId>`. These can be used to construct key-value types like a dictionary.
- Added `WindowsRegistry.Shared` for a shared instance of `IRegistry`.
- Wine: added `GetUserName`, `ProtonWinePrefix` will now use `steamuser`.
- Enabled [Trimming](./README.md#trimming).

**How to upgrade**:

The transition from `Result<TGame>` to `OneOf<TGame, ErrorMessage>` should be straight forward. You can use the provided helper methods for [matching](https://github.com/mcintyre321/OneOf#matching) like `result.Match(game => { }, error => { })` or `result.Switch(game => { }, error => { })` depending on your needs. I've also added some extension methods to make the transition easier:

- `bool IsGame()`
- `bool IsError()`
- `TGame AsGame()`
- `ErrorMessage AsError`
- `bool TryGetGame(out TGame)`
- `bool TryGetError(out ErrorMessage)`

Store handlers, like `GOGHandler`, now require an implementation of `NexusMods.Paths.IFileSystem`, instead of `System.IO.Abstraction.IFileSystem`. You can use the shared instance at `NexusMods.Path.FileSystem.Shared`, if you want to use the real file system.

For testing, you can either mock `NexusMods.Paths.IFileSystem`, or use `NexusMods.Paths.InMemoryFileSystem`. If you need to do more in-depth testing, you can also use the `NexusMods.Paths.TestingHelpers` package.

Since `AHandler<TGame, TId>` has changed, you might need to update the constraints for `TId`, if you use generics. Simply add `where TId : notnull` to the constraints. All Ids have been replaced to using value objects. For example: instead of having `long id` for `GOGGame`, it's now `GOGGameId id`. You can still get the value using `id.Value`, which is still a `long`.

**How to use with Wine on Linux**:

See the updated [README](./README.md#wine).

## [2.6.0](https://github.com/erri120/GameFinder/compare/v2.5.0...v2.6.0) - 2023-03-07

- removed support for `net6.0`
- add support for finding Wine prefixes (check the [README](./README.md#wine))
- Steam: added new default installation directories:
    - `~/.steam/debian-installation` (apparently used on Debian/Ubuntu systems)
    - `~/.var/app/com.valvesoftware.Steam/data/Steam` (used by the flatpak installation)
    - `~/.steam/steam` (legacy installation, links to another installation)

## [2.5.0](https://github.com/erri120/GameFinder/compare/v2.4.0...v2.5.0) - 2023-01-17

Added support for EA Desktop. Read the [wiki entry](https://github.com/erri120/GameFinder/wiki/EA-Desktop) before using.

## [2.4.0](https://github.com/erri120/GameFinder/compare/v2.3.0...v2.4.0) - 2023-01-13

Although this release contains some API changes and a lot of internal changes, consumers will likely not be affected.

- Core: `AHandler.FindAllGamesById` now returns `IDictionary<>` instead of `Dictionary<>`
- Core: changed `Result<TGame>` from a record struct to a custom readonly struct
- Steam: added `SteamGame.GetManifestPath` that returns the absolute path to the parsed manifest. This is useful if you need to extract more information from the manifest, after the game has been found.
- Internal: restructured the project and reworked all tests

## [2.3.0](https://github.com/erri120/GameFinder/compare/v2.2.2...v2.3.0) - 2022-12-16

- Steam: added `~/.steam` and `~/.local/.steam` as possible default Steam directories on Linux
- Steam: added constructor that accepts a custom Steam path in case the library can't find it
- upgrade to C# 11
- upgrade `System.IO.Abstractions` to v19.1.1

## [2.2.2](https://github.com/erri120/GameFinder/compare/v2.2.1...v2.2.2) - 2022-11-11

- `FindAllGamesById` will no longer throw an exception for duplicate IDs

## [2.2.1](https://github.com/erri120/GameFinder/compare/v2.2.0...v2.2.1) - 2022-10-21

Small update that changes the equality comparer of the dictionary returned by `EGSHandler.FindAllGamesById` and `OriginHandler.FindAllGamesById` to `StringComparer.OrdinalIgnoreCase`.

## [2.2.0](https://github.com/erri120/GameFinder/compare/v2.1.0...v2.2.0) - 2022-10-21

This update adds some utility functions you can use. I've also created a new package `GameFinder.Common` where all those new utility functions live:

- added `AHandler` an abstract class that all store handlers inherit:
  - `AHandler.FindAllGames`: same function as before
  - `AHandler.FindAllGamesById`: wraps `FindAllGames` and returns a `Dictionary<TId, TGame>`
  - `AHandler.FindOneGameById`: if you just need to find 1 game
- added some extension methods that work with `IEnumerable<Result<TGame>> results`:
  - `IEnumerable<TGame> OnlyGames`: returns only non-null games and discards the rest
  - `IEnumerable<string> OnlyErrors`: returns only non-null errors and discards the rest
  - `(TGame[] games, string[] errors) SplitResults`: splits the results into two arrays

## [2.1.0](https://github.com/erri120/GameFinder/compare/v2.0.1...v2.1.0) - 2022-10-21

Minor update after the major rework:

- everything was made safer and less functions will throw (you should still wrap the `FindAllGames` function call)
- API changed a bit: `FindAllGames` will now return a readonly record struct instead of a named tuple
- lots of internal changes and more tests

## [2.0.1](https://github.com/erri120/GameFinder/compare/v2.0.0...v2.0.1) - 2022-10-19

- Origin: fix parsing manifests with duplicate key-value entries

## [2.0.0](https://github.com/erri120/GameFinder/compare/v1.8.0...v2.0.0) - 2022-10-15

Major rework of all packages:

- removed `netstandard2.1` target
- added `net7.0` target
- added `IRegistry` interface with `WindowsRegistry` and `InMemoryRegistry` implementations
- added runtime platform check in all packages
- deprecated the Bethesda.net and Xbox packages (see [README](./README.md) for more information)
- removed logging from all packages
- removed the `GameFinder` package (it's not needed anymore)
- simplified the public APIs

## [1.6.0](https://github.com/erri120/GameFinder/compare/v1.5.3...a280ce37eacd33ab7198651e8486fc411c056611) - 2021-07-10

This update reverted the change from [v1.5.0](#150---2021-05-29) because it did not perform very well, made the code worse and harder to read and felt like a quick and dirty fix. The reason why I even added `Result<T>` was to let the consumer of this library, which should be an application, know what went wrong by returning something akin to Rust's error propagation. Instead of having an exception whenever something went wrong, it would just add another error as a `string` to a `List<string>` inside the `Result<T>` which the consumer can access and print out. I have removed all of this code and replaced it with simple logging using `ILogger` from `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging`. This way you can simply pass a `ILogger` to the constructor of a Store Handler and it will log to it. Since the consumer of this library is an application which likely has some form of logging going on, this should be very easy to implement.

Additionally I finally went ahead and added Origin Support, see the [README](README.md) for more information.

### Changed

- Using `ILogger` from `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging` instead of custom `Result<T>` to let the user know what went wrong

### Added

- Added Origin Support, see [README](README.md) for more information
